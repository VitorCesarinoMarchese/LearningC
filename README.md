# Learning C

A collection of small projects built while learning the C programming language.

## 📚 What I Learned
- Working with **strings**, **pointers**, and **functions**.
- Using **header files** to organize code.
- Handling files with `fopen`, `fscanf`, `fprintf`.
- Generating random values with `rand()` and seeding with `time()`.
- Using **loops**, **if statements**, and `#define` for constants.
- Understanding **data types** like `int` and `double`.

## 🕹️ Projects
- [Hangman](https://github.com/VitorCesarinoMarchese/LearningC/tree/main/hangman) – A word-guessing game with file I/O and dynamic word list.
- [Guessing Game](https://github.com/VitorCesarinoMarchese/LearningC/tree/main/guessing_game) – A number guessing game using random numbers and score calculation.
